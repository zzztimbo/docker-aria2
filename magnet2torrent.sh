# Mail: weirdcrap    [(at)]     protonmail [dot]  com              #
# Version: 0.4 (beta)                                              #
# Purpose:                                                         #
# I wrote/tested this to enhance the functionality
# of Sonarr/Radarr's torrent black hole feature to convert .magnet #
# files (links) into a torrent file that rtorrent could natively   #
# import through my specified watch folder while preserving my     #
# custom labels, download directories, etc.                        #
# If you found this script then you must already know my pain lol  #
#                                                                  #
# Function:                                                        # 
# This loops through all the .magnet files in the directory saved  #
# in $FILES and passes them through to aria2c which takes          #
# the infohash or magnet url and turns it into a .torrent file that#
# rtorrent can then import through its watch folder.               #
#                                                                  #
# How to use:
# 1) install aria2 (sudo apt install aria2)
# 2) Aria2c daemon should be running i.e.
# aria2c --daemon --enable-rpc=true --enable-dht --dht-listen-port=6881
# 3) make sure incomming port 6881 (TCP and UDP) is open (forwarded) on your router/firewall
# 4) Replace $DIR with the watch directory path you have
# .magnet files being saved into by sonarr/radarr/sickgear/etc.
# 5) make sure this script is executable (chmod +x magnet2torrent.sh)
# 6) add this script to cron (crontab -e)
# */1 * * * * ~/magnet2torrent/magnet2torrent.sh
